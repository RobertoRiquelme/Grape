# ``ForceSimulation``

Run force simulation on any dimensions.

## Overview

`ForceSimulation` is a force simulation library that enables you to create any dimensional simulation with velocity Verlet integration. The basic concepts of simulations and forces can be found here: [Force simulations - D3](https://d3js.org/d3-force/simulation).
