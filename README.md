## Examples

### Force Directed Graph
This is a force directed graph visualizing the data from [Force Directed Graph Component](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph-component), iterating at 120FPS. Take a closer look at the animation:

Source code: [ContentView.swift](https://github.com/li3zhen1/Grape/blob/main/Examples/ForceDirectedGraphExample/ForceDirectedGraphExample/Miserables.swift).

### Force Directed Graph in visionOS

This is the same graph as the first example, rendered in `RealityView`:

Source code: [ForceDirectedGraph3D/ContentView.swift](https://github.com/li3zhen1/Grape/blob/main/Examples/ForceDirectedGraph3D/ForceDirectedGraph3D/ContentView.swift).


<br/>

### Lattice Simulation

This is a 36x36 force directed lattice like [Force Directed Lattice](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-lattice):

<br/>


## Usage

<br/>

### `Grape`


```swift
import Grape

struct MyGraph: View {
    @State var isRunning = true // start moving once appeared.
    
    var body: some View {
        ForceDirectedGraph(isRunning: $isRunning) {
            
            // Declare nodes and links like you would do in Swift Charts.
            NodeMark(id: 0, fill: .green)
            NodeMark(id: 1, fill: .blue)
            NodeMark(id: 2, fill: .yellow)
            for i in 0..<2 {
                LinkMark(from: i, to: i+1)
            }
            
        } forceField: {
            LinkForce()
            CenterForce()
            ManyBodyForce()
        }
    }
}
```

Here's another [example](https://github.com/li3zhen1/Grape/blob/main/Examples/ForceDirectedGraphExample/ForceDirectedGraphExample/MyRing.swift) rendering a ring with 60 vertices created with a SwiftUI View `ForceDirectedGraph` from `Grape`, with out-of-the-box dragging support:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `ForceDirectedGraph` is only a minimal working example. Please refer to the next section to create a more complex view.

### `ForceSimulation`

`ForceSimulation` module provides 2 kinds of classes, `NDTree` and `Simulation`. 
- `NDTree` is a KD-Tree data structure, which is used to accelerate the force simulation with [Barnes-Hut Approximation](https://jheer.github.io/barnes-hut/).
- `Simulation` is a force simulation class, that enables you to create any dimensional simulation with velocity Verlet integration.

#### Basic

The basic concepts of simulations and forces can be found here: [Force simulations - D3](https://d3js.org/d3-force/simulation). You can simply create simulations by using `Simulation` like this:

```swift
import simd
import ForceSimulation

/// Create a 2D force composited with 4 primitive forces.
let myForce = SealedForce2D {
    Kinetics2D.ManyBodyForce(strength: -30)
    Kinetics2D.LinkForce(
        stiffness: .weightedByDegree(k: { _, _ in 1.0 }),
        originalLength: .constant(35)
    )
    Kinetics2D.CenterForce(center: .zero, strength: 1)
    Kinetics2D.CollideForce(radius: .constant(3))
} 

/// Create a simulation, the dimension is inferred from the force.
let mySimulation = Simulation(
    nodeCount: width * width,
    links: edge.map { EdgeID(source: $0.0, target: $0.1) },
    forceField: myForce
) 

/// Force is ready to start! run `tick` to iterate the simulation.

for mySimulation in 0..<120 {
    mySimulation.tick()
    let positions = mySimulation.kinetics.position
    /// Do something with the positions.
}

```

See [Example](https://github.com/li3zhen1/Grape/tree/main/Examples/ForceDirectedGraphExample) for more details. 

<br/>

<!-- #### Advanced

Grape provides a set of generic based types that works with any SIMD-like data structures. To integrate Grape into platforms where `import simd` isn't supported, or higher dimensions, you need to create a struct conforming to the `VectorLike` protocol. For ease of use, it's also recommended to add some type aliases. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```swift
/// All required implementations should have same semantics
/// as the SIMD protocol provided in the standard library.
struct SuperCool4DVector: VectorLike { ... }

protocol HyperoctreeDelegate: NDTreeDelegate where V == SuperCool4DVector {}
typealias HyperoctBox = NDBox<SuperCool4DVector>
typealias Hyperoctree<TD: HyperoctreeDelegate> = NDTree<SuperCool4DVector, TD>

typealias Simulation4D<NodeID: Hashable> = SimulationKD<NodeID, Vector4d>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When using generic based types, you ***pay for dynamic dispatch***, in terms of performance. Although their implementations are basically the same, it's recommended to use `Simulation2D` or `Simulation3D` whenever possible. -->

## Roadmap

|   | 2D simd | ND simd | Metal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **NdTree** | âœ… | âœ… |  |
| **Simulation** | âœ… | âœ… |  |
| &emsp;LinkForce | âœ… | âœ… |  |

| &emsp;CenterForce | âœ… | âœ… |  |
| &emsp;CollideForce | âœ… | âœ… |  |

| &emsp;RadialForce | âœ… | âœ… |  |
| **SwiftUI View** | ðŸš§ |  |  |

## Performance

Grape uses simd to calculate position and velocity. Currently it takes ~0.015 seconds to iterate 120 times over the example graph(2D). (77 vertices, 254 edges, with manybody, center, collide and link forces. Release build on a M1 Max, tested with command `swift test -c release`)

For 3D simulation, it takes ~0.019 seconds for the same graph and same configs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to heavy use of generics (some of which is not inlined in Debug mode), the performance in Debug build is ~100x slower than Release build. Grape might ship a version with pre-inlined generics to address this problem.
